===============
=: Your Game :=
===============

- What game are you planning to implement? If it is a game of your own design,
  or not especially well-known, provide a 2-3 sentence description of the game.

  In this game, you control a little spaceship that sails through the dangerous
  galaxy, escaping evil aliens. You can shoot star boulders from your spaceship,
  to hit the alien. If the spaceship collides with the alien, the alien dies, but
  but the spaceship loses health.

- What classes and interfaces do you plan to create? How will the different
  components of your game (the model, the GUI, etc.) interact?
  
  I will have a super class called the GameObj that everything in this galaxy
  will inherit from. Itâ€™ll inherit methods like position, moving the object,
  clipping the object in place etc

  I will also have an interface for the alien, since most alien manipulation is done without specifying which type of alien it is,

  For classes, I have a spaceship class to manipulate the spaceship, a boulder class,
  to manipulate the boulder star that the spaceship shoots out. Under the alien interface,
  I have 3 alien classes for the different types of Aliens. The Red for red aliens, Orange
  for orange aliens, and Health class for alien hearts that the spaceship can collect to gain
  Health.

- What do you think will be the most challenging thing to implement?
  The collision detector between the shapes. I'll have to check if they collide and look into
  the alpha class etc
